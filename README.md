# Sports_Person_Classifier
A website that classifies different images into 5 different sports personalities namely Virat Kohli, Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams and Roger Federer. It displays the image of the sports person with which the input image resembles along with the probability table.

Classification Model: Comparison between SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression was done to check which model with different parameters performs best.
According to the result it was SVM with parameters- 'svc__C': 1, 'svc__kernel': 'linear'.
Now the this model is trained and then exported. And based on this model the website works.
